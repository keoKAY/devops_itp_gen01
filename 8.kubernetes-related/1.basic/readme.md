## NOTE 
- Working with pod 
```bash 

# imperative approach 
kubectl run demo-nginx --image=nginx:latest 

kubectl apply -f pod.yaml 

kubectl get pod  -w    # watch it in realtime 
watch kubectl get pod # watch it in realtime 2s refresh


kubectl logs -f pod-name 
kubectl describe pod-name 
kubectl get pod -o wide 
curl PORT_IP
```

- Replicaset 
Control how many identical pods are running 
```bash
kubectl get rs 
kubectl delete rs rs-name
watch kubectl get pod 
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> 


```
