## NOTE 
Working with Taint node , node selector  and Affinity 



## Taint nodes 
Mark node to recieive or not recieve tasks assignment 
( Pod will need node to run , but not on the nodes that we tainted )
- Taint Node = remark , mark to specific that the node will no longer run any tasks from scheduler 

```bash 
kubectl get node 
kubectl get node -o wide 

kubectl get node --show-labels 
# kubernetes.io/hostname=node1

kubectl describe nodes 
kubectl describe nodes | grep Taints 

kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,TAINTS:.spec.taints
```
- Typically there is **no taint** for the default workers , because worker need to run pods 
- Typically there is a **taint for the master** to prevent from running normal job or workloads to avoid being overload and overwhelm which might increase the chance of server being down. 

```bash 

# used to taint any master 
kubectl taint node node1 node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=:NoSchedule

# untaint master1 , so that it can run normal workload like other 
kubectl taint node node1 node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane-



# in order taint the worker nodes 
kubectl taint node node5 service=disabled:NoSchedule
# untaint the worker node 
kubectl taint node node5 service=disabled:-NoSchedule
```
